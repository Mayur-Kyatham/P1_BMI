# BMI Calculator
This BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a Python script that calculates your BMI based on your height and weight. 
It then categorizes your BMI into different ranges and provides a corresponding message.

## BMI Categories
If your BMI is less than 18.5, you are underweight.

If your BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9 (inclusive), you have a normal weight.

If your BMI is between 25 and 29.9 (inclusive), you are slightly overweight.

If your BMI is between 30 and 34.9 (inclusive), you are obese.

If your BMI is 35 or greater, you are clinically obese.

## Note
The BMI calculation is based on the formula: BMI = weight / (height ** 2).
